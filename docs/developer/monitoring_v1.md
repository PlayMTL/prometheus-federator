## [Legacy] What is Monitoring / Alerting V1?

Monitoring / Alerting V1 are the legacy solutions that Rancher offered as the default Monitoring / Alerting solution via the Cluster Manager UI up till Rancher 2.4.x.

In Rancher 2.5.0+, Cluster Monitoring / Alerting V1 has been deprecated in favor of a single Monitoring V2 solution, which also supports Alerting.

In Rancher 2.6.5+, Project Monitoring / Alerting V1 has been deprecated in favor of a single Prometheus Federator solution, where each Project Monitoring Stack also supports Alerting.

This document will cover the major differences between Monitoring V1's offerings in comparision to Monitoring V2's offerings from a technical perspective.
